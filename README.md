# Langtache

> NOTE: WIP, don't use in production yet.

A quick way to offramp from LangChain.

Drop in replacements for popular LangChain types, without the OOP hell.

## Why this?

Well, LangChain is...not frankly what I would like to use anymore, something that I never thought I would do when I first tried it out in early 2023.

Turns out, many other are facing the same situation, so I just decided to put up this small package.

Also, from most use cases that I have seen (as per my limited knowledge), they involve just plain templating that could've been done with a templating language already. This project is a step in that direction, to reduce the OOP madness.
